- streaks as a feature
- how to use custom logic in validation, such as:
	- if streak is 5, stay away game, don't count it
	- if conf > threshold, stay away game
- could we get over/unders for each game from somewhere?


- missing top players as a feature
- more "allowed" statistics
- generate report of each training
	# of wins / # losses
	money amounts for 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 confidence bets
	highlight winners
	record which features were being trained, name for it
- find a way to move the model to embargo that is used to do fake bets and see how well it is doing, then promote to prod and do real tests
- use small allocations for new strategies, increase as they perform better, decrease with time

- generate top players for the upcoming games
