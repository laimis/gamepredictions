- combine training and test into one table and step that is evaluation

- generate 2017 evaluation sheet
	- away, home, projected, actual --- does anybody stand out? -- biggest upsets --- when

- losing stream feature
- road trip streak feature
- use date calcs in deciding the strength (theory is that this should increase the accuracy of confidences)
- analyze wrong predictions, anything that stands out? injury? rest? back to back
- head to head team comparison for each

- evaluate should output game info into table
- percentage thought, won, loss, and output that so that can do analysis what the games it thinks it lost


- adjust to 10 day rolling average
- experiment with graphical point graphing
- try trainng without winning pct and only diff and 3pt
- get xgboost working for testing and predicting
- reverify the stats
- try 10 different models vote on answer, and see how many times it is right if they all agree
