- streaks as a feature
- missing top players as a feature
- more "allowed" statistics
- change train/test splits to 2015/2016/2017 - 2018
	more research of train/test/validate splits
- could we get over/unders for each game from somewhere?
- generate report of each training
	# of wins / # losses
	money amounts for 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 confidence bets
	highlight winners
	record which features were being trained, name for it
- find a way to move the model to embargo that is used to do fake bets and see how well it is doing, then promote to prod and do real tests
- use small allocations for new strategies, increase as they perform better, decrease with time

- generate top players for the upcoming games
